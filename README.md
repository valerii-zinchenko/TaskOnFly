# TaskOnFly
TaskOnFly gives you an easy way to track your tasks from any device with HTML5 compatible browser and enabled JavaScript.

You can create tasks and group them in lists. Lists of tasks also can be nested.

Specify task priority (low, normal, high) to track its importance. All tasks are sorted by priority in descend order, so you can easy plan your work and check what with what priority is left to do.

Use FastTask form to create a task more faster. You don't need to navigate to some page with full form. Just type the task title, select suitable priority and click on "+" to add it into the current list.

Use FastSearch form to find a task by title in the current task list.
